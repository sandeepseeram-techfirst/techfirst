Maven is a tool for building and managing your Java-based projects. 
It is the most used build tool among Java developers and provides the following benefits:

* Simplifies the build process
* Uniform build system
* Project information
* Encourages better development practices


All Maven projects start with a simple pom.xml and grow in complexity from there.


Maven POM
The pom.xml Project Object Model (POM), is the core of a project's configuration in Maven. You can define metadata about your project, dependencies, plug-ins, and control things like build process and package management.

By default, Maven expects your source code to be in /src/main/java + groupId.  

In your pom.xml, you defined your groupId as:

<groupId>com.oreilly.books</groupId>
This means that your source code should be stored in /src/main/java/com/oreilly/books
