Maven Archetype Plugin

an archetype is a plugin that defines four goals. 

mvn archetype:generate creates a Maven project from an archetype, asks the user to choose an archetype from the archetype catalog, and retrieves it from the remote repository. Once retrieved, it is processed to create a working Maven project.

mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.4
