###### Agression Levels 

AGGRESSION:
The aggression level controls the trade-off between speed/stealth and
reliability.
  --aggression, -a=LEVEL        Set the aggression level. Default: 1.
  1. Stealthy                   Makes one HTTP request per target and also
                                follows redirects.
  3. Aggressive                 If a level 1 plugin is matched, additional
                                requests will be made.
  4. Heavy                      Makes a lot of HTTP requests per target. URLs
                                from all plugins are attempted.
