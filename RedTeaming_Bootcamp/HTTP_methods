#### HTTP Methods

The following are the different HTTP methods:

GET: Retrieves information from the server
HEAD: Basically the same as GET but returns only HTTP headers and no document body
POST: Sends data to the server (typically using HTML forms, API requests, and so on)
TRACE: Does a message loopback test along the path to the target resource
PUT: Uploads a representation of the specified URI
DELETE: Deletes the specified resource
OPTIONS: Returns the HTTP methods that the server supports
CONNECT: Converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel
