#### Introducing the Trivy Scanner 

Trivy is an Aqua Security open source project. Trivy can be used to find software vulnerabilities and security misconfigurations.
It can also scan three different artifacts:

1. Docker Container Images
2. Filesystem and Rootfs
3. Git Repositories

Trivy can be run in standalone mode or in a client/server configuration.

The Trivy scanner is designed to be used in continuous integration (CI) environments. For example, before you push a container to a registry or deploy your application, you can scan your local container image and other artifacts for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
