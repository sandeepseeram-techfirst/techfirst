Application programming interfaces or API’s are was in which computers can communicate to one another programmatically. 
The de-facto standard for modern API’s is Representational State Transfer or REST, leveraging the HTTP protocol. 
REST API’s work function utilizing a client-server model in which an HTTP endpoint is published to provide some functionality. 
HTTP clients make appropriate method calls to the endpoint to trigger the desired action.


Requirements: 

* Use Python to send an API call.
* Build and run a Flask HTTP server.
* Build a HTTP route to make a new HTTP API endpoint.

Software: 

Python 3.7+
Python requests (installed with pip install requests)
Python Flask (installed with pip install flask)
Git
Postman.

HTTP METHODS: 

An HTTP GET method is used by a client to retrieve data from a server. The most common way we typically interact with this is through a web browser when viewing web pages. Additional methods perform various operations, and the following are some of the most common:

GET: Retrieve data
POST: Create, update, or overwrite data
PUT: Update data
PATCH: Update or append data
DELETE: Remove data
