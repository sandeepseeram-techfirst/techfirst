The core components in MongoDB are:

mongo: The MongoDB shell itself, an interactive JavaScript shell interface to MongoDB that you can use to connect and run commands
mongod: The primary daemon process, the core process for the MongoDB system
mongos: The process that routes queries and writes operations in a sharded cluster


Sharded cluster: This clustering feature from MongoDB allows distributing data across multiple machines (scale-out), for very large data sets and high-throughput operations.
