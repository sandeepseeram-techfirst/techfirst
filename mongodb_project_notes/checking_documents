Those are the most common helpers used to visualize the structures in MongoDB.

In general, each helper has an equivalent JavaScript command that performs the same operation, as seen below:

Helper	                           Equivalent
use playground	         db.getSisterDB("playground")
show dbs	             db.getMongo().getDBs()
show collections	     db.getCollectionNames()
