In MongoDB, there are a range of query operators you can use to compare values, including the following:

$and: Joins query clauses with a logical AND, returning all documents that match the conditions of both clauses
$not: Inverts the effect of a query expression, returning documents that do not match the query expression
$nor: Joins query clauses with a logical NOR, returning all documents that fail to match both clauses
$or: Joins query clauses with a logical OR, returning all documents that match the conditions of either clause
