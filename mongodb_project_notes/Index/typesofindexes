What Kind of Indexes Exist on MongoDB?
The list of index types is long, and each type is suited for a specific scenario. 
But all of them have the same purpose: to help you speed up your query.

Available index types include the following:

Single field
Compound
Multikey
Text
Wildcard
2dsphere
2d

Hashed
Single-field and compound indexes are the most commonly used; they are the standard form to index one or multiple fields.
