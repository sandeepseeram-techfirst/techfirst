What Is an Index?
A database index is similar to a bookâ€™s index. Instead of looking through all the content, the database takes a shortcut and just looks at an ordered list referencing the content.

Why? 
Indexes support efficient execution of queries in MongoDB. When querying without indexes, MongoDB must perform a collection scan, that is, scan every document in a collection, to select those documents that match the query statement.
